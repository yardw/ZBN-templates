# question
As a professional product designer, I have several critical concerns about this feature proposal that need clarification:

  1. Target User Confusion

  Who exactly is this for? You mention "research workflows" but also "emergent storytelling" and "treasure-hunting." Are we building a research methodology tool, a game, or a simulation engine? These serve fundamentally different user needs and mental models.

  2. Value Proposition Clarity

  What problem are we actually solving? Traditional research tools like Zotero, Notion, or even simple spreadsheets already handle systematic research workflows. Why would a researcher choose this complex "treasure-hunting" interface over proven tools?

  3. Cognitive Load vs. Usability

  You claim "minimal effort, maximum return" but then describe:
  - Achievement systems, grades, progress bars
  - Slash commands, breadcrumb trails, version history
  - Multi-dimensional scoring, event systems
  - Extension architectures, wiki documentation

  This seems like maximum cognitive overhead. How do you reconcile this contradiction?

  4. Interface Design Inconsistency

  You emphasize "plain text interface" but show HTML examples with progress bars, color coding, and complex layouts. Which is it? Plain text or rich formatting? These are fundamentally different design approaches.

  5. Gamification Justification

  Why does research methodology need badges, grades, and achievements? Research is already intrinsically motivated work. Won't this gamification actually distract from rigorous methodology and create perverse incentives?

  6. Technical Constraints Impact

  Your "TypeScript-only, single folder, plain text" constraints seem to drive design decisions rather than user needs. How do these technical limitations actually benefit the researcher's experience?

  7. Extension System Complexity

  You describe extensions that "have no dependencies on core engine" but can "depend on other extensions." This creates potential dependency hell. How will non-technical researchers manage this complexity?

  8. Discovery vs. Methodology

  Research methodology is about systematic, reproducible processes. "Treasure discovery" and "emergent storytelling" suggest serendipitous, unpredictable outcomes. These seem philosophically opposed. Which paradigm takes priority?

  Challenge: Can you define a single, clear user persona and their specific pain point that this tool addresses better than existing solutions?

# answer
1. we are building a simulation engine that strong enough to carry a serious scientific research recording. So the user is scientific researcher who want to be productive. 
2. This tool is designed to record atomic research information, reduce cognitive loads, discover inspirations and provid instant feedback. 
3. Achievements, grades, progress bars are instant feedbacks to let user feel rewarded and motivated. slash commands are introduced to enhance the limitation of plain text prompt interaction to enable the common operations like choose a choice, push a button etc.. multi-dimensional scoring and event system are designed to help analyse the status of the user, figure out the possible directions and provide inspiration or even surprises. extensions and wiki are necessary for a researcher to build personal knowledge base and congnitive patterns. 
4. The prompt support html formatting but I removed rich formatting after review test examples, so now we focus on plain text. 
5. even if research is intrisically motivated work, the feedback is long-term and undetermined. However, the instant feedback can help user to incrementally enrich thier knowledge and accumulate experiences. So gamification suffice the blanck before long-term feedback apears. 
6. I agree that ts-only, single folder, plain text are design decisions. These considerations are from the limitation to directly impliment into template of zotero or other softwares. 
7. I agree, I  am not sure of this risk. you can give your advice. 
8. emergent event system takes priority. Here "Treasure discovery" should be understand as a "catch-ball" game, where the event system emergent the events with rewards in the system and the user's research life.

Conclusion:
- user persona: scientific researcher who want to be productive
- pain point: existing tools are too rigid and do not provide instant feedback or emergent inspiration
