# Feature Proposal: Socratic Research Training Engine

## Overview
A text-based card game engine designed for PhD-level research training, specifically for theoretical physics researchers preparing for journal club presentations, paper defense, and academic discussions. The system uses a Socratic dialogue approach where an AI "Socrates" attacks your understanding with various challenge cards, and you must defend using your knowledge and reasoning skills.

## Core Game Mechanics

### **The Socratic Battle System**
```
Socrates draws Attack Card → You choose Defense Card → Resolution → Rewards/Penalties → Next Round
```

The engine simulates the high-pressure environment of academic discourse where you must defend your research under expert scrutiny. Each session prepares you for real-world scenarios like journal clubs, thesis defenses, and peer review.

## Example Battle Session

### **Opening Engagement**
```
=== SOCRATIC BATTLE: Journal Club Preparation ===
Paper: "Novel Dark Matter Candidates from String Theory"
Battle Readiness: 67% | Confidence: B+ | Session: 1/5

Socrates draws: ★ METHODOLOGY ATTACK ★
"Your paper claims the dark matter mass is naturally around 1 keV, 
but the calculation assumes the string scale is 10^16 GeV. 
What if the string scale is actually 10^18 GeV?"

Defense Cards Available:
[1] Mathematical Proof - Recalculate with different string scale
[2] Limitation Acknowledgment - Admit model dependence
[3] Counter-Attack - Question string scale determination
[4] Experimental Evidence - Cite observational constraints
[5] /help - View card descriptions

Your defense: _
```

### **Successful Defense**
```
You played: [1] Mathematical Proof
"The mass scaling is M_DM ∝ M_string^2/M_Planck, so if M_string 
increases by 100, M_DM increases by 10^4, giving ~10 MeV mass.
This is ruled out by structure formation, so string scale 
must be ≤ 10^17 GeV."

Socrates: "Impressive! You correctly identified the scaling 
and connected to cosmological constraints."

★ PERFECT DEFENSE ★ (+100 points)
★ UNITS UNICORN PROGRESS ★ (8/10)

Battle Readiness: 67% → 71%
Confidence: B+ → A-
```

### **Failed Defense Leading to Learning**
```
You played: [4] Experimental Evidence
"Current X-ray observations show excess at 3.5 keV..."

Socrates: "That signal is controversial and doesn't address 
the mass scaling issue. You avoided the mathematical challenge."

★ FAILED DEFENSE ★ (0 points)
★ WEAK SPOT IDENTIFIED ★ String phenomenology calculations

Study Quest Generated:
- Review string scale determination methods
- Practice mass scaling calculations
- Connect string parameters to observables

Battle Readiness: 67% → 65%
Next recommendation: Review mathematical proof techniques
