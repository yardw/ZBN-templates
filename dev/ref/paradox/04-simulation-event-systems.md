# Simulation and Event-Driven Design Patterns

## Executive Summary

Paradox games are built around **complex simulation systems** that model real-world processes through interconnected, event-driven architectures. These systems create emergent gameplay through the interaction of multiple autonomous subsystems operating on different timescales.

## Core Simulation Architecture

### Multi-Layered Simulation Model
```
Global Layer (World Events, Climate, Technology)
    ↓
Regional Layer (Trade, Politics, Culture)
    ↓
Local Layer (Provinces, Cities, Characters)
    ↓
Individual Layer (Units, Buildings, Resources)
```

### Temporal Scaling System
**Multiple Time Horizons:**
- **Immediate (Days)**: Combat, movement, short-term decisions
- **Short-term (Months)**: Economic cycles, seasonal effects
- **Medium-term (Years)**: Technological development, political changes
- **Long-term (Decades)**: Cultural shifts, demographic changes

## Event-Driven Architecture

### Event System Foundation
**Core Event Types:**
1. **Scripted Events**: Pre-written historical or thematic events
2. **Procedural Events**: Generated based on game state
3. **Player Events**: Triggered by player actions
4. **System Events**: Internal game system communications

### Event Scheduling and Processing
```cpp
class EventManager {
    priority_queue<Event> eventQueue;
    
    void processEvents() {
        while (!eventQueue.empty() && eventQueue.top().getTime() <= currentTime) {
            Event event = eventQueue.top();
            eventQueue.pop();
            
            executeEvent(event);
            scheduleFollowupEvents(event);
        }
    }
}
```

### Event Data Structure
```pdxscript
country_event = {
    id = event_id
    title = "Event Title Key"
    desc = "Event Description Key"
    picture = "event_image"
    
    trigger = {
        # Conditions for event to fire
        stability = { min = 2 }
        technology_group = western
        NOT = { has_country_flag = event_fired }
    }
    
    mean_time_to_happen = {
        months = 120
        modifier = {
            factor = 0.8
            stability = { min = 3 }
        }
    }
    
    option = {
        name = "Accept"
        effects = {
            add_stability = -1
            add_prestige = 10
            set_country_flag = event_fired
        }
    }
}
```

## Simulation Subsystems

### 1. Economic Simulation
**Resource Flow Model:**
```
Production → Trade → Consumption → Investment → Production
```

**Implementation Pattern:**
- **Monthly Updates**: Resource production and consumption
- **Market Dynamics**: Supply/demand price calculations
- **Trade Route Simulation**: Goods flow between regions
- **Economic Shocks**: Random events affecting markets

### 2. Political Simulation
**Power Dynamics:**
- **Stability Systems**: Internal faction management
- **Diplomatic Relations**: Dynamic relationship calculations
- **Succession Mechanics**: Ruler change consequences
- **Revolution Triggers**: Instability cascade effects

### 3. Military Simulation
**Combat Resolution:**
```cpp
class BattleSimulation {
    BattleResult simulate(Army attacker, Army defender, Terrain terrain) {
        // Phase-based combat calculation
        for (int phase = 0; phase < maxPhases; phase++) {
            calculateCasualties(attacker, defender, terrain);
            checkMoraleBreak();
            if (battleEnded()) break;
        }
        return generateResult();
    }
}
```

### 4. Technological Progress
**Research System:**
- **Technology Trees**: Prerequisite-based advancement
- **Research Points**: Abstract progress currency
- **Innovation Events**: Breakthrough mechanics
- **Technology Diffusion**: Spread between regions

## State Management Patterns

### Game State Architecture
```cpp
class GameState {
    Date currentDate;
    Map<CountryId, Country> countries;
    Map<ProvinceId, Province> provinces;
    TechnologyManager techManager;
    EventManager eventManager;
    DiplomacyManager diplomacy;
    
    void dailyUpdate() {
        updateDate();
        processEvents();
        updateCountries();
        updateProvinces();
        checkVictoryConditions();
    }
}
```

### Save Game Serialization
**State Persistence:**
- **Full State Snapshots**: Complete game state at save time
- **Delta Compression**: Store only changes since last save
- **Version Compatibility**: Handle saves across game versions
- **Mod Compatibility**: Graceful handling of missing mod data

## Emergent Behavior Patterns

### Cascade Effect Systems
**Chain Reaction Design:**
```
Economic Crisis → Political Instability → Military Weakness → 
Foreign Intervention → Territory Loss → Further Economic Crisis
```

### Feedback Loop Implementation
```pdxscript
# Economic feedback loop
modifier = {
    trade_income_modifier = 0.1
    condition = {
        stability = { min = 2 }
        manpower_percentage = { min = 0.8 }
    }
}

modifier = {
    trade_income_modifier = -0.2
    condition = {
        stability = { max = -1 }
        war_exhaustion = { min = 5 }
    }
}
```

### Stochastic Elements
**Randomness with Purpose:**
- **Weighted Random Events**: Probability based on game state
- **Random Seed Management**: Deterministic randomness for multiplayer
- **Chaos Theory Elements**: Small changes with large consequences

## Dynamic Balance Systems

### Adaptive Difficulty
**Rubber Band Mechanics:**
- **Catch-up Mechanics**: Help struggling players/AI
- **Challenge Scaling**: Increase difficulty for successful players
- **Regional Balance**: Prevent single-power dominance

### Power Balance Algorithms
```cpp
class BalanceManager {
    void checkPowerBalance() {
        float totalPower = calculateWorldPower();
        for (Country country : countries) {
            float powerShare = country.getPower() / totalPower;
            if (powerShare > DOMINANCE_THRESHOLD) {
                triggerBalanceEvents(country);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Performance Optimization for Complex Simulation

### Update Frequency Management
**Tiered Update System:**
- **Critical Systems**: Every day (combat, diplomacy)
- **Important Systems**: Every week (economy, stability)
- **Background Systems**: Every month (culture, technology)
- **Long-term Systems**: Every year (demographics)

### Computational Efficiency
```cpp
class OptimizedSimulation {
    void updateEconomy() {
        // Only update provinces with changes
        for (Province p : getChangedProvinces()) {
            p.updateEconomy();
        }
        
        // Batch process similar calculations
        parallelFor(provinces, [](Province p) {
            p.calculateProduction();
        });
    }
}
```

### Memory Management
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse event and calculation objects
- **Lazy Loading**: Load detailed data only when needed
- **Cache Management**: Store frequently accessed calculations
- **Garbage Collection**: Minimize allocation during gameplay

## Quality Assurance for Simulation Systems

### Simulation Testing
**Automated Testing:**
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure consistent behavior across versions
- **Load Testing**: Performance under maximum complexity
- **Edge Case Testing**: Extreme scenarios and boundary conditions
- **Balance Testing**: Long-term game outcome distribution

### Debugging Tools
```cpp
class SimulationDebugger {
    void logEvent(Event event) {
        if (debugMode) {
            log("Event: " + event.getId() + 
                " at " + event.getTime() + 
                " for " + event.getTarget());
        }
    }
    
    void validateGameState() {
        checkResourceBalance();
        validateDiplomaticRelations();
        verifyTechnologicalProgress();
    }
}
```

This event-driven simulation architecture enables Paradox games to create complex, believable worlds where player actions have far-reaching consequences, supporting the emergent storytelling that defines the Paradox experience.
