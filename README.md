let's do something interesting -- you can imagine it is a plain text based adventure game! what users can do is filling questionnaires, and based on their answers, they will be given a different path to follow. 

A good game should minimize the effort of the user and maximize the return. Here is the strategy:
1. Options > words > sentences, for less effort
2. Show the incremental progress of the user, so they can see how far they have gone and how well they are doing
    2.1. it is good to have a progress bar showing the percentage of completion
    2.2. it is good to have a achievement system and a grade system, so users can see how well they are doing
3. Make sure users can undo their previous actions with small effort, so they can explore different paths without losing their progress
4. Allow users to revise their answers, so they can improve their answers and get better performance
5. Although the game is plain text based, it is good to have some pretty formatting
6. Connecting previous cleared records to investigate "treasures" (i.e., insights, similar ideas, more clear understanding, etc.). So it is better to leave informative trackpoints in the records as much as possible.

Aha, I cheated a bit so far, because this project is actually not a game, but a incremental research action recording engine. That means, the "questionnaires" are indeed very systematic and structured, and the "paths" are actually different research actions that users can take based on their answers. So we have to take it seriously and make sure the questionnaires are well designed and the paths are meaningful. Before concering about the content of the questionnaires, we should make the framework first.

1. The engine should be extensible for its questionnaires and paths, easy to maintain and update.
2. The engine should be flexible enough to support complicated, contextualized questionnaires and paths.
3. The engine should be able to handle large amount of data and provide efficient search and retrieval of information.
4. The engine should provide a user-friendly plain text based interface with the instructions and feedback well-formatted in concise html strings.

Please follow the above strategy to write a feature proposal with example usages. DO NOT implement the code!
